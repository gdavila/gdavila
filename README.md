### About this repo

This repo contains a bunch of code I use in my daily work as **Media Solution Architect** and other tools I made on previous experiences.

Some of my main contributions:

- [rttExplorer](https://github.com/gdavila/rttExplorer): Tool to make QoS meassurements over internet by using rtt. It uses tracebox and scamper.
